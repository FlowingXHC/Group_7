    <h2>Database Administrators</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Database administrators, in short DBA, are literally people who take a charge of databases. They create, add, modify records in databases. To explain in detail, they are responsible for making sure that databases and data can be backed up adequately while recovering ASAP when there are certain failures. They also measure database in order to maintain the integrity within it in terms of accuracy whilst deny unauthorized users to access certain data.<br />

            DBAs are the central contact point for the organization which uses the database management systems. This means while there is no direct communication ongoing among fellow workers, they always should be prepared and opened to any communication for any events that may occur. Therefore, DBAs must keep up to date on the latest versions and capabilities. They also educate and provide appropriate information to application developers and users regarding the methods of using the database and facilities.<br />

            Challenging aspect of this profession would be the ability to catch the root causes when failure happens, while quickly and appropriately solve the problem. To effectively use this root cause analysis requires DBAs to acquire certain abilities which are, for example, identifying bottlenecks and points of contention or monitoring workload and throughput, etc.<br />

    <h2>Network Administrators </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Network administrators are people who install computer networks and make sure that networks are being ran properly and securely. Most of the people confuse these professionals with Database administrators, but their works certainly differ from each other. Most of the network administrators work within organizations and agencies to monitor local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) and other data communication systems when in needs. Therefore, one can say while DBAs concentrate on managing database itself, network administrators mostly focus on constructing smooth network system in organization so that members can freely and efficiently communicate to each other.<br />

            With that being said, most of the people they contact with are fellow workers. As I aforementioned, network administrators focus on how computers interact with one another via LAN, WAN, and other elements of network system. This especially means a lot when it comes to individual workers who must contact whenever they need to with fellow workers. When the communication system is in failure, network administrators are the one who communicate most with workers.<br />

            The most challenging aspect of this profession is a capricious work environment since they have to manage network system while preventing and fixing problems and supporting teams and members. This requires them to have a vague time schedule compared to other workers. It is common that network administrators to work overtime to complete projects, solve problems or enhance the network system. Some may even work on call in case emergency while they are not in a business hour.<br />

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <h2>Systems Analysts </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Systems analysts are professionals who combine business and information technology to advocate businesses to optimize their systems. They use data modeling to design computer systems which enables them to observe the processes and data flows before implementing they system. As soon as the program is written, system analysts conduct in-depth tests while analyzing information in order to catch any trends in the data. With this process, they can get a clue regarding the means to increase performance and efficiency of a system.<br />

            Systems analysts mostly communicate or collaborate with computer programmers, UX designers and quality assurance testers to build up computer systems. When they are affiliated to certain organization, they also work with chief executives and advise other technology teams to better understand the best way of computer system to serve an organization. Also, they specialize in certain types of computer systems which are directly related to the types of industry. For example, these analysts are called IT project managers because they trace a project’s progress in order to ensure the deadlines, standards or cost targets are being satisfied or not.<br />

            Challenging aspect of having this job would be responsibilities. As I mentioned above, most of them specialize in certain types of computer system. This means their responsibilities vary by what kind of projects they are involved in. Sometimes it would be challenging for them to move into different company or industry since certain industry may require a whole different computer system that these analysts may not be familiar with.<br />

    <h2>Web Designer </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Web designers are people who create, build, fix websites or web pages by utilizing visual design elements such as but not limited to text, photos, graphics. Even though they are not a professional who is responsible for the code or database, but this does not necessarily mean they should not be regarded as non-professional. Instead of mastering code skills or data management, they focus more on creating positive user experience when users visit the website. They may use programming languages such as CSS and JavaScript, while capable of using graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop.<br />

            In this sense, different from the other IT professionals, most of the people they interact with are client who request them to create or update the design of the website. The client does not necessarily mean individual only. Company, organization, government agencies also interact with many web designers since the use of website has been consistently increasing.<br />

            There would be several challenging aspects of this professional, but I believe that sense for design and understanding of client’s need and preference would be most challenging. Especially for the sense for design, this may not be overcome by the pure effort but rather a given talent. However, I am not saying the effort is meaningless since web designers devote their time in web design. They study web design theory like structure and color theory, while constantly looking for and experiencing the latest tools to make better websites and web pages.<br />

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <h2>Data Scientist </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Data scientists are people who analyze data and solve problems by visualizing data, identifying meaningful patterns, while generating algorithms through programming languages and software tools. Most companies make real-world decisions through the given data. Therefore, the necessity of data scientists has been growing rapidly. They help companies make decisions by creating mathematical models, basis for more data-based decision-making.  Especially in these days, companies which regard big data as an important and crucial resources are wanting more data scientist who are capable of providing adequate and precise data to them.<br />

            Therefore, most people (or organization) who interact with data scientists would also be somewhat a “client”. As I mentioned earlier, recently most of companies are requiring the ability to provide sufficient and precise information from big data by visualizing collected data and generating algorithms. Naturally, as the demand of data scientists has been increasing, there are more connection and communication being done between client (company, organization, government agency, etc) and data scientists.<br />

            One of the most challenging aspects of this profession would be high requirement of ability to generate algorithms and techniques. Data scientists have to collect abundant amounts of unruly data and reshape it into a usable format. They also have to fully educate themselves to be capable of staying top of analytical techniques such as machine learning, deep learning or text analytics.<br />

    <h2>So, where does the IT professional spend most of their time anyway? </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>If this literally implies “where” as place, then have to say it differs what kind of industry and company they are working in. However, one may say that most of IT professionals, as same as other workers who have different works in other industries, are involved in certain entities such as but not limited to companies, organizations or government agencies. This paragraph like to emphasize that IT professionals do not only dwell in IT industry, but rather had spread throughout the several industries since the importance and necessity of knowing and utilizing IT skills and abilities are becoming more important than ever before. </p>
