            Haosheng Jiang is one of the members of team Lucky, his student number is s3631290. He was born in China and completed primary school, middle school and high school education in China, and now he is doing the final year of bachelor of information system in RMIT. The languages he can speak are Mandarin, Cantonese, Teochew and English. Like many boys, he like to play video games on the computer.<br />

            He has been playing video games since he was very young, and he was facing many various problems with computer and unable to run games, at that time, it was always necessary to find various ways to debug the settings of the computer and the installed software to make the game run. Since then, he has developed a strong interest in computers. However, in later life, technology has progressed very rapidly, and many things need not only be changed in the settings, but also need to be modified and tried at the code level. At that time, he knew that it was difficult to modify or build a system with his talent. On the other hand, he also realizes that the era of the future will be the era of software. As more and more technology platforms are developed, they can bring various functions and learn some knowledge about the future development is helpful, especially in business and production. Before he started the undergraduate degree, he had completed diploma of information technology, learned the most basic database construction, able to use html to edit and design web pages, so that the web pages and the database are synchronized. He also learned some basic network construction, java programming and developed simple programs on Android.<br />



            The three test results of Haosheng:<br />

            The results of an online Myers-Briggs test (https://www.16personalities.com/):<br />

            From the test results, we can know that Haosheng is full of passion and energy in his heart, he is creative and imaginative, he likes wild ideas, he longs for a deep relationship, but he easily feels lonely or invisible.<br />

            His learning mode is Tactile-Kinesthetic Modality, he needs to make frequent movements to help him learn, such as co-editing documents, discussing problems online, but it also means that he needs to make a lot of movements to help him enter the learning state, and after learning for a short period of time, he needs to rest for a short period of time, which means he needs to switch between different actions to obtain higher learning efficiency.<br />

            In the Big Five personality test, we recognized that Haosheng likes to solve problems and try to do things better, but is also more susceptible to negative emotions, and being frustrated in teamwork may make him suffer more psychological damage and do react negatively.<br />

    <h2>Yibo Ding</h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            My name is Yibo Ding, who is study in Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My student number is s3885516 and my student email address is s3885516@student.rmit.edu.au. I’m major in Information Technology currently. I also studied Foundation in Australia and just graduated last year. As I come from China, I can speak Chinese and English. I have two joys in my life —— basketball and music. Whenever I have time, I spend it on these two hobbies. Playing basketball is not only good for my physical health but also let me make friends. Through this sport, I learned how to work with others and realized the significance of teamwork. I also enjoy the feeling that music brings to me. With the help of music, I can keep the chaos from the surrounding world away and see my deep inner clearly.<br />

            I have set Information Technology as the direction of my future career since high school. I had my high school in China, at that moment, I got an opportunity to learn about some basic knowledge of Information Technology. I was so excited about this wonderful technology that can bring conventions to human life in an amazing way. Since that, I became interested in it.<br />

            The results provide a scientistic conclusion to me. According to the results, I got a new and clearer understanding of myself. Now, I’m clear about what’s my personality advantages and disadvantages. Based on that information, I could develop my future direction to gain benefit and improve my weaknesses.<br />

            The test of personalities type shows I am an INFP which also knows as the Healer group. I symbols for Introversion, N for iNtuition, F for Feeling and P for Perceiving. Being an introversion means that I’m willing to stay alone rather than spend my time with others. As I can’t gain energy from the social activities, I think I will drop some unnecessary social activities for saving me energy. Although I have been classified to iNtuition, the result shows that I’m a bit of both Sensor and Intuitive. So, I’m usually using both styles and have able to switch from one to another depends on the demands in the environment I’m in when I am processing information. I believe it’s an advantage in my personality. The test classified me as “F” (Feeling) which means I’m a sensitive person. But the result also said that I’m neither an absolute thinker nor a feeler type. So, I’m neither totally on my logical nor emotion when I need to make decisions. The last symbol of my personality is “P”, because I like to keep things casual and open-ended. I think this personality explains why I like to change my decisions at the last-minute and it might be the weakness for me. Based on this result, I would tend to turn myself more scheduled and organized in the future.<br />

            The other test shows that my learning type is visual. It explains that I can gain knowledge better when I read or see pictures. In this point, I am going to change my current learning method to be more visually oriented in order to improve my learning efficiency.<br />

            For the last test, I have been classified as a romantic person who trade job and behavior as the way to express my inner self. Under those tests’ help, I see myself clearer and have some specific directions to change myself.<br />

            Overall, the tests indicate that I have great skill in processing information and making decisions and those skills are important for any teamwork. And I’m good at analytic of visual resources which can be helpful in a team. Also,<br /> I’m kind of person who has imagination and creativity and always has the unique ways to bringing meaning and determination to myself and people around me.

I'm a critical thinker, constantly analyzing how things (and people) around me could be improved. I am not afraid to point out what is wrong in the world, and my mind is forthright and unsparing in its judgment. I value personal achievement and progress, don't expect help from anyone, and take responsibility for getting what I want in life. I value the combination of tradition and innovation. I'm usually content to do things the way the transformation works until it stops working, at which point I'm happy to use the new approach.<br />

            To sum up, I am outgoing, careful and more judgmental.<br />
