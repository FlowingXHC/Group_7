    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    <div class="para">
        <p>

            Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can be automatically improved through experience and the use of data (Mitchell 1997). The state-of-the-art in machine learning algorithms is supervised learning methods (seniorcare2shaare n.d.), but in fact machine learning in different fields uses different learning methods. The most popular types are supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.).<br />

            Supervised learning is that the computer continuously adjusts the function according to the input items and corresponding output items of the data sets given by the operator (Russell and Norvig 2016), using the input items and output items given by each example of the training data set, construct a function which can use the input item mapping output item (Mohri et al. 2018). Supervised learning algorithms analyze training data and generate inference functions that can be used to map new examples. The optimal solution will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels of unseen instances.<br />



            Most industries that deal with large amounts of data have already understood the value of machine learning and have established corresponding algorithms to use it in the corresponding fields, including finance, public services, medical care and retail (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.). In the financial services industry, banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning techniques to identify important insights in data and prevent fraud. These insights will help investors understand and identify investment opportunities and when to trade, while mining the data can identify users with high-risk characteristics, warning financial institutions to prevent fraud.<br />

            In public services, governments and utilities can improve efficiency and save money through data analysis, and machine learning can also improve the profitability of the transportation industry by improving the efficiency of lines and predicting potential problems in transportation.<br />

            In medicine, through the information collected by various devices and sensors worn by patients, machine learning can help medical experts analyze data, identify features and give suggested diagnoses, which can reduce misdiagnosis and detect lesions in time.<br />

            In retail, many websites currently record and analyze users' characteristics by capturing users' online data and search records. Algorithms will assign specific tags and enable suppliers to provide users with personalized recommendations and marketing activities.<br />



            Modern technology, especially information technology, is changing with each passing day. It is believed that in the near future, more advanced machine learning can be more applied in the following fields (TechVidvan n.d.).<br />

            Robotic machine learning technology, some robots will use machine learning to obtain the function of serving guests in specific scenarios, such as serving guests in restaurants, and interacting with customers in hotels, airports, and banks.<br />

            In terms of geology, it can simplify oil distribution and expand benefits by analyzing subsurface minerals (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.). In the future, it may also be possible to develop advanced algorithms and use seismic data to train functions capable of predicting earthquakes.<br />

            In terms of weather forecasting, machine learning can build specific models to monitor changes, obtain data over a period of time and predict future weather conditions. Some of these functions are already in the process of research and development and experimentation and may be better in the future.<br />

            In the development of the ocean, machine learning can help measure pollution, study the movement and behavior of various species, it can be used to detect and analyze ocean topography, measure habitat distribution, and help study tectonic plates.<br />



            At present, machine learning is very dependent on the scale of computing power of computers and better training models. Therefore, in order to make breakthroughs in computing power of computers in the future, it is necessary to wait for the practical application of quantum computers, and the improvement of models can also make machine learning can be applied in more aspects (Zhydik 2021).<br />

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            The impact of machine learning is broad, not only positive but also negative.<br />

            The positive impact is that machine learning brings artificial intelligence, and this can be applied to many aspects of society and life. By editing algorithms and programs, the skills acquired by these software after artificial intelligence through machine learning can be installed in Hardware to achieve a variety of functions, such as the use of automatic robots to improve the production efficiency of factories, the use of artificial intelligence to achieve automatic driving with the help of sensors, and smart furniture to bring convenience to life. In many enterprises, by establishing specific algorithms and combining It can improve the operating efficiency and interest rate of enterprises. These will increase the efficiency of human society and increase the demand for talents for machine learning programming (Thomas 2021). In the process of adding algorithms, many machine learning models will be open sourced, which avoids a lot of repetitive work, which promotes the rapid upgrade of machine learning algorithms. Enterprises can also apply existing functions without having to develop them themselves. However, individual and special needs still require a large number of programmers to upgrade and maintain the system, which will provide more employment space for those who learn IT technology.<br />



            In terms of negative effects, because machine learning requires a large number of data sets for training, enterprises, governments and organizations will collect more information, including a large amount of personally identifiable information, face models and biological data, and the collection of data will gradually become necessary, and with the help of a large number of artificial intelligence and corresponding robots and algorithms, enterprises will need fewer people in traditional positions, and some will be replaced by artificial intelligence (Ascott 2021). Collecting information will affect everyone in society, and artificial intelligence will replace workers' jobs, which will make people with corresponding skills unemployed and have to learn new skills (Semuels 2020), such as assembly line workers, financial operators, courier sorters and proofreaders etc. (Saviom Software Pty. Ltd. 2021)<br />

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            In my daily life, what I come into contact with the most is the artificial intelligence trained by machine learning, and what I need to face is the results and impact of artificial intelligence. The first change is the collection of data. Due to the extensive use of various algorithms, more data is required, whether these data will be used for future machine learning training or provided to service providers so that it can provide personalized services and push notifications Personalized advertisements, but in many cases, the collection of this information is excessive. They not only collect information about the part that can provide services, but also collect as much as possible or even covertly and illegally in other aspects, and ordinary users are not aware of it.<br />

            In fact, the development of these technologies brings more convenience. Spam filtering and classification of e-mail mailboxes. In the past, you had to identify and delete spam yourself, and important emails also had to be classified by yourself, but now many mailboxes have the function of automatically identifying spam, which saves lots of trouble. Then there are map navigation and public transportation system query tools. Thanks to the combination of GPS and artificial intelligence, the current map can not only locate the user, but also give the best route and calculate the required time after setting the destination. Which can also be changed according to different needs.<br />



            Of course, the social software developed by machine learning and the algorithm of shopping recommendation have deep impact on my family and friends. These software generally recommend articles that match their views and interests, and recommend related product reviews, which undoubtedly deepens their views of their owned and becomes difficult to accept other opinions, and product reviews that easily arouse their desire to buy items, and sometimes they may not need these items, especially after a period of time, these items are never use again, which cause material and financial waste.<br />

    <h2>Clouds, services, servers </h2>
    <p>In this particular essay, I would like to deliver you the information about the service called “Cloud” by explaining its definition, capabilities and how it started. Then I would like to briefly mention its influence toward the world and the users. Last but not least, I would like to provide my personal experiences regarding this technology. <br /></p>
    <h3>Definition and Capability</h3>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Cloud computing is internet-based computing. It is a service that places a program on a virtualized server on the internet and calls it to a device whenever needs it. As the word “cloud” depicts, one can take and use cloud computing resources (CPUs, memory, etc.) anywhere in the internet network if it is connected. Being surrounded by clouds means that you can take out and use whatever one want without having to look inside and know it, and one can gurantee it wherever, whenever the internet is connected<br />

            Through the continous development of it, currently its’ state of the art is to provide four distinct services which are; Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platforms-as-a-Service (Paas), Software-as-a-service (Saas), and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)(Citrix System, Inc. n.d). IaaS is a service that provides computing, networking and storage resources to users. PaaS is a service that provides platfrom and IT infrasturcutre that enables that platform to utilize application. For SaaS, it provides platform-based infrastructure and platform that runs cloud application. Lastly, FaaS is a event-based running model which support users to functionally structure, run and manage application package without the maintenance provided by developer (Amazon n.d).<br />

            Apart from the type of service, cloud computing has three differnet types which are; Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. Public Cloud is, as we can see by the name, an opened cloud system which enables annonymous users who are connected to intertnet to use its service. Hardware, software and other infrastructures are possessed and managed by the supplier of cloud service while users can approach the service and manage its individual account based on the internet network. Private Cloud, on the other hand, is a service that only allows authorized individual to access the data stored in the cloud. Most of the company and organizations favor this type of cloud system because of its excellent security. Hybrid Cloud is a combination of Private Cloud and Public Cloud (Hunter 2020). Whenever managing the data that requires high level of security, one can save the data at on-premise data center. But it also allows one to utilize Public Cloud when processing request excceeds the capability of data center due to a steep rise of traffic.<br />

            Cloud service possesses a lot of advantages for both wevservice manager and users of it. For the webservice manager, one is not required to consider location, power, and scalabiility of the server when purchasing. Also, manager can use the server that is already prepared in the data center, which allows one to concentrate only on service operation while not considering settings of the server. For the users, its’ advantages are mostly focused on the convenience. By using cloud service, one can be liberated from the limitation of hardware storage. One can also freely upload or download files such as images, videos and programs whenever the device is connected to the internet. To add with, one can now freely share the files with others regardless of geographic distance. For both manager and users, cloud service ensures the safety of datas as it is not saved in the hardware devices, therefore increasing high reliance toward its system.<br />

            The very first cloud computing system was created at the early 2000s from the Amazon. The developers were focused on creating IT infrastructure environment such server purchase, software installation rather than their core work of developing. Hence, board of directors considered the means to enhance such inefficiency and to increase productivity, which led to an emergence of ‘Amazon Web Service’ which can efficiently utilize computing resources.<br />

            So, one can say the early period of cloud computing focused on increasing efficiency of utilizing limited human, material resources. However, as the big data market arises, its’ utilization is being focused more on managing skyrocketed data rather than economic aspect of cost cutting.<br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="gap"></div>
    <h2>Impact toward the World and the User </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            As I before mentioned, the current cloud computing is focused on managing high volume of datas. As its efficiency and convenience became recognizable, most of the companies, entities, organizations and individuals are developing and using the cloud computing both as a provider and user of it. And its’ influence and preferrence seems to be unstoppable.<br />

            Through the unprecedented pandemic situation called COVID-19, the untact culture had spread worldwide and naturally the cloud market also grew rapidly. This is because an environment where data can be accessed and multiple contents can be used anytime, anywhere with the Internet has become so important. According to the statistics, global spending on cloud infrastructure services grew 35% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, reaching approximately $42 billion. In South Korea, the government is also creating an ecosystem to revitalize the could as a part of the digital new-deal project to prepare for post COVID-19. Thefore, companies in various fields such as IT, finance, games, and commerce are building cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, the pace of digital transformation is expected to accelerate in the future. Cloud services are a key driver, and by 2024, 90% of the ‘Global 1,000 companies’ are expected to adopt cloud technology for their work. Beyond individuals and businesses, cloud services are building a hyper-connected era and creating new services and opportunities that have never been before.<br />

            As the industry of cloud computing is skyrocketing, it is highly probable that company, organization will require employees who is capable of managing cloud computing or at least one who knows well of it. Naturally, as the demand for skilled person regarding cloud computing by firms increases, the society will shape differently to satisfy such demand by supplying the people through the education, increase in college administration of certain major related to cloud computing.<br />

            Personal Experience: How it is affecting me (300 words)<br />

            As the individual who is acquainted with, or rather is familiar with modern devices such as iPad, labtops and other high-tech devices, it is only natural that I am also familiar with using cloud services. When there was no concept or realization of cloud service, the only way to save my data was to use hardware devices such as floppy disc, cd, usb, and as time passed by, labtop and smartphone. When I lose one of the device or the device being malfunctioned, it meant a total loss of the data, which can never be recovered by any means of it. Although preparing back up files at the different devices didn’t necessarily means the security of the data since it repeats the same consequence whenever I lose another one. However, in these days, I can safely upload my files to a cloud service provided by company such as Google or Naver, and freely download them wherever and whenever I need them if my device is connected to the internet. This does not only accounts for myself, but it is also relevant to most of my friends, family or even acquaintances. Recently I am sharing my photos and videos with my family regardless of time and space. If my parents want my photos, all I have to do is select the photo and click ‘upload to cloud’ button on my device.<br />

            The cloud system will also affect my future, since most of the companies are eagerly and passionately using and developing cloud computing. When I get employed in the future, the company will require me to share the files with fellow workers through the cloud system, whilst setting certain rules to secure the data by uploading to a data center provided by the company or the cloud system.<br />

    <h2>Cybersecurity </h2>
    <h3>Introduction： </h3>
    <div class="para">
        <p>At present, with the continuous development of Internet technology, many branches have gradually entered people's field of vision. Computers have gradually transformed from a machine that can only execute fixed algorithms into a new type of intelligent machine with more functions, and various computer technologies are gradually entering the mainstream in the continuous development, such as machine learning, network security, blockchain and encryption. Technologies such as money and natural language processing and chatbots that may have never been thought of before have matured over time. Next, I will introduce the current frontiers of these technologies in turn and discuss the potential impact on our daily lives. <br /></p>

            In 2015, AlphaGo (Fu, 2019)"turned out", causing a small climax stage of artificial intelligence development. This is also the first step for artificial intelligence to defeat humans. In the field of chess and other fields, better strategies were obtained through exhaustive search. Of course, such a strategy cannot be applied to the field of Go. We all know that the possibility of the field of Go is very high. There is simply no way to complete the judgment on the current move and so on through exhaustive methods. Therefore, people have not thought that artificial intelligence can make a big breakthrough in Go. The three core technologies used by AlphaGo: "Monte Carlo Tree Search (Fu, 2019)", "Reinforcement Learning (Zhe et al. 2022)", and "Deep Neural Network (Wang et al. 2022)". Strategies such as evaluating the current state. After searching for the next state, and giving the score for each step, the loss value is calculated. After learning tens of thousands of human games through the deep neural network, the loss value is reduced to achieve the purpose of optimization. At the same time, artificial intelligence is also applied to various aspects, such as image processing, and a lot of artificial intelligence knowledge is also applied. For example, Maskrcnn (Dorrer et al. 2021), the most recent pixel-level image segmentation technology, is shown in the following figure:



            Its algorithm can extract features from images, learn rules from these features, and perform segmentation and classification operations on objects in images (foreground). In the future, this technology will make real-time detection and image segmentation possible, and there will be more professional development in the direction of automation.

            In the field of network security, the current main technologies are: to ensure that the hardware, software and data in the network system are protected, not damaged, changed, or leaked due to accidental or malicious reasons, and the system operates continuously, reliably and normally, Network service is not interrupted. These technologies are very mature. Cybersecurity is an important part of the national security system. In 2020, the global network security situation is still very serious. Not only the security vulnerabilities of widely used software/hardware devices such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Linux system and Android system are frequent, but also large-scale personal information and business data leakage and violations broke out. The use of incidents has caused serious harm to society and people's livelihood, economic development and national stability. At the same time, with the development of quantum computers, many conventional difficult problems can be solved by polynomial time algorithms under quantum attack (Zhang, 2022). Therefore, there are five main post-quantum cryptography algorithms: code-based cryptography, multivariate cryptography, hash-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and homologous cryptography, such that the fundamental problem of cryptography makes cybersecurity Survive a quantum attack. Such technology can also ensure that the agreement between the two parties is very secure in the future where quantum computers are popular.

            In the field of blockchain (Tsan-Ming et al. 2022) and cryptocurrency, from "mining" to the most popular blockchain and digital currency. An open, transparent, immutable, decentralized ledger and smart contracts are realized. This is one of the reasons why blockchain is now called the hot Internet technology. In cryptocurrency, since the distributed blockchain network has credible information records, the equivalent exchange value corresponding to various transactions can be recorded in the blockchain; and this credit requires the computing power of miner nodes to maintain, it is necessary to give a certain incentive value to the miners who successfully solve the new block while adding a new block. It is these two reasons that together give birth to the endogenous currency of the distributed blockchain network. Bitcoin is the best example. And its transaction characteristics are also very unique. Bitcoin's ledger system does not record everyone's balance (Balance), otherwise the ledger will still record all transactions of each independent account. On the contrary, a Bitcoin transaction data is essentially an invoice bill. When the payer (sender) pays, the source of funds of the current transaction is confirmed by backtracking the invoice received by the payer in the previous transaction. This retrospective also ensures that at least logically, each transaction will not be double spent. It improves computing security and other aspects, and fully realizes a decentralized transaction method.

            In the field of natural language processing, the word2vec (Tosin et al. 2022) technology used in the field of synonym and antonym search from the beginning edits each word into the form of a vector, and calculates the weight relationship between two words to determine whether two words are synonyms or antonyms. At present, a series of new natural language processing technologies have been proposed, such as information extraction: information extraction is the process of extracting and converting unstructured information embedded in text into structured data, and extracting names from the corpus composed of natural language The relationship between entities is a deeper research based on named entity recognition. The main process of information extraction has three steps: first, the unstructured data is automatically processed, the second is the targeted extraction of text information, and the last is the structured representation of the extracted information. The most basic work of information extraction is named entity recognition, and the core is the extraction of entity relationships. Based on the classic Transformer model, first proposed by the Google team. Transformer is a model that accelerates deep learning algorithms based on attention mechanism. The model consists of a set of encoders and a set of decoders. The encoder is responsible for processing inputs of arbitrary length and generates its expression, and the decoder is responsible for converting the new expression into Purpose word. The advantage of Transformer is that the attention mechanism can directly capture the relationship between all words in a sentence without considering word positions. The model abandons the previous traditional encoder-decoder model, which must be combined with the inherent mode of RNN or CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN), and uses the full Attention structure instead of LSTM, which reduces the amount of calculation and improves parallel efficiency without compromising the final experimental results. But this model also has flaws. First of all, this model is too computationally expensive, and secondly, there is also the problem that the use of position information is not obvious, and it cannot capture long-distance information. Such computing methods will become possible in the future, such as strong artificial intelligence dialogue.

    <h2>Conclusion </h2>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            Such computer technologies are just four of the many branches of technology that, without exception, make our lives easier. Although some repetitive and mechanized jobs will disappear with the birth of artificial intelligence in the near future, a batch of new jobs will be created in emerging technology fields. Therefore, computer technology is undoubtedly constantly promoting people's progress and development. Perhaps many years later, we will gradually lose a lot of eyesight and manual labor, and liberate our hands. More workers only need to sit in the computer room and observe the computer screen to ensure the normal and smooth operation of the machine. Similarly, with the development of technologies such as network security and blockchain, many industries will emerge as the times require, and operational positions such as blockchain and virtual currency will be created. The network security service industry will also gradually emerge, and more and more companies will incorporate network security into their professional considerations. For natural language processing, more service industries, such as telephone customer service, will be replaced by robots. Human services are rarely involved.

            In my current life, the computer knowledge I have learned has a better inspiration for me to deal with things, and has provided many ways of thinking. Can better improve all aspects of learning and life. Learning this knowledge allows us to better integrate our lives with extracurriculars and many other aspects. Many of the basic knowledge we are learning now is the basis for these professional directions. It will be helpful for me to choose these majors in the future. While friends and family are more convenient to use these technologies, I will also think about the principles and other ways to improve these technologies.
