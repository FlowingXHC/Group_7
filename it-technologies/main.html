    <h3>What does it do?</h3>

            Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can be automatically improved through experience and the use of data (Mitchell 1997). The state-of-the-art in machine learning algorithms is supervised learning methods (seniorcare2shaare n.d.), but in fact machine learning in different fields uses different learning methods. The most popular types are supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.).<br />

            Supervised learning is that the computer continuously adjusts the function according to the input items and corresponding output items of the data sets given by the operator (Russell and Norvig 2016), using the input items and output items given by each example of the training data set, construct a function which can use the input item mapping output item (Mohri et al. 2018). Supervised learning algorithms analyze training data and generate inference functions that can be used to map new examples. The optimal solution will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels of unseen instances.<br />



            Most industries that deal with large amounts of data have already understood the value of machine learning and have established corresponding algorithms to use it in the corresponding fields, including finance, public services, medical care and retail (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.). In the financial services industry, banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning techniques to identify important insights in data and prevent fraud. These insights will help investors understand and identify investment opportunities and when to trade, while mining the data can identify users with high-risk characteristics, warning financial institutions to prevent fraud.<br />

            In public services, governments and utilities can improve efficiency and save money through data analysis, and machine learning can also improve the profitability of the transportation industry by improving the efficiency of lines and predicting potential problems in transportation.<br />

            In medicine, through the information collected by various devices and sensors worn by patients, machine learning can help medical experts analyze data, identify features and give suggested diagnoses, which can reduce misdiagnosis and detect lesions in time.<br />

            In retail, many websites currently record and analyze users' characteristics by capturing users' online data and search records. Algorithms will assign specific tags and enable suppliers to provide users with personalized recommendations and marketing activities.<br />



            Modern technology, especially information technology, is changing with each passing day. It is believed that in the near future, more advanced machine learning can be more applied in the following fields (TechVidvan n.d.).<br />

            Robotic machine learning technology, some robots will use machine learning to obtain the function of serving guests in specific scenarios, such as serving guests in restaurants, and interacting with customers in hotels, airports, and banks.<br />

            In terms of geology, it can simplify oil distribution and expand benefits by analyzing subsurface minerals (SAS Institute Inc. n.d.). In the future, it may also be possible to develop advanced algorithms and use seismic data to train functions capable of predicting earthquakes.<br />

            In terms of weather forecasting, machine learning can build specific models to monitor changes, obtain data over a period of time and predict future weather conditions. Some of these functions are already in the process of research and development and experimentation and may be better in the future.<br />

            In the development of the ocean, machine learning can help measure pollution, study the movement and behavior of various species, it can be used to detect and analyze ocean topography, measure habitat distribution, and help study tectonic plates.<br />



            At present, machine learning is very dependent on the scale of computing power of computers and better training models. Therefore, in order to make breakthroughs in computing power of computers in the future, it is necessary to wait for the practical application of quantum computers, and the improvement of models can also make machine learning can be applied in more aspects (Zhydik 2021).<br />
