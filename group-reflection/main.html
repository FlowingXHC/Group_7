            Group Reflection

            Haosheng Jiang:

            I think I've done my best to lead the group to complete the assignments and to distribute as fairly as possible what the members are supposed to do. I think that there is still room for improvement in the mode of meeting and the clear expression and communication of information, especially after completing some content that needs to share information, I should be actively sent it to our members ranther than just put it on Microsoft team. One of the members of the group surprised me with her personal page, and I have to admit that she is very competent in web design. Unfortunately, there are a lot of paper works for this assessment with poor online collaboration, and our team has problems with communication in a timely and effective manner, so we can only use a very simple web design. Therefore, the activity log on github does not reflect our group's work on this task.





            Haochuan: I think I did well in persuaded people to use my project idea and I did a lot detail work about my project. We did well on overcome a lot of diffucuty, such as hardware/software or language etc, we did this assignment as what we are holping for.

            May be we can improved on the planning and orginzed stuff, we should set up a task for every one more detaily and we also need to get things done faster.

            I am suprising that we can talk to each others like a old friend, that makes our work easier.

            What I learn in our groups is we should do as the MS Team, make everyone the leader, so everyone can take a part and a part of responsibility, so everyone can lead this team march.



            Haohao:

            Everyone in the team has done his/her work carefully, and if other team members don't understand something, they will actively help him/her to understand the content. However, I think we should have a more systematic division of labor, or a clearer assignment of tasks. In our group, there is a person who has done a very good web page, we all have a strong interest in IT. In our group. I learned that. Haochuan has been interested in computers since he was a child. Haosheng wants to be a field engineer. Finally, we will share our opinions together. I am very happy to cooperate in this group.



            Huijoon Jang

            At first, everyone was awkward, so the progress of the assignment was slow, but the guys did well until the end. If there was anything I didn't know, I told them in detail. Next time, however, I think we should start dividing the division of task faster and in more detail. What I have learned is that the more we are communicate, the better the quality.



            Yibo:

            About our group, everyone is very helpful. When I don't understand something, Haochuan will tell me how to understand it. In terms of allocation, our team leader also did a good job. However, sometimes we couldn't have a meeting at the same time, but everyone's progress was obvious and everyone was seriously involved in the project.





            Group:

            Most of the members of our team have quite good ability, and when each member clearly knows their own tasks, they can complete most of the work that belongs to them, which enables our team to complete our assessment before the deadline become possible.

            There is a lot of room for improvement in our group. First of all, in terms of communication, the members of our group may be shy and introverted, and it is difficult to express and share their opinions clearly. In the assignment meeting, most of the group members are not clear about the information assigned to the work and do not understand Instead of asking questions and expressing their opinions, they chose to accept them. If the group members can put forward their own views and questions in the meeting, sufficient communication can fully improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the meeting.

            Second, most of members have a passive attitude in understanding information and completing assessments on their own. Most of the group members never read carefully and really understand the introduction part of Assessment 2, which leads them to be negligent or confused about what they need to do, and have problems with many details, such as referencing (RMIT Harvard Referencing is updated). If all group members can read and understand the introduction of the assessment, it will make the group work better and communicate more efficiently.

            Finally, it is very difficult to organize group meetings. The group has the problem of setting a time to organize the meeting, there are many times some members choose not to respond or respond too late. The group members are surprisingly busy, and some of them was unable attend the meeting or their devices were unavailable in many meetings, and leave in a hurry after the meeting. If group members can organize faster, the efficiency and atmosphere of the group will be greatly improved, and the pressure faced by all members will be reduced.

            However, when time was short, our group exploded with surprising cohesion, and these pressures pushed us to sit down to communicate and collaborate online to get the job done together.

            Through this cooperation of our group, we fully understand some factors that need to cohere the group, good organizational skills, positive attitude and sufficient communication, these can promote a group to make better works and come up with higher efficiency, and we hope that those areas that are not doing well can be improved in the future.
