            The job title for my ideal job is technical support engineer, according to the top IT job titles from Labour Insight jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) (2018), in the top 200 most in-demand occupations in the IT industry, it ranks 62nd, although the demand for this position is not high, but they are the backbone of maintaining the operation of the company.<br />

            The IT-specific skills are required for my job include SQL, Microsoft Windows, JAVA, Building Relationships, technical support, customer service, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Excel, Windows Server and System Administration, according to the top IT skills from Labour Insight jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) (2018), those skill rank 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th,12th, 14th, 21th, 26th, 81th in the top 200 most demand IT-specific skills. Some of the required skills are important skills that are in high demand, and some are not very important to the market and can only be used in specific occupations.<br />

            The general skills are required for my job include communication skills, problem solving, organisational skills, writing, team work/ collaboration, troubleshooting, planning, detail-orientated, time management, mentoring, analytical skills, management, computer skills, listening, preventive maintenance, Chinese, English as a Second Language. Those skills are rank 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 26th, 37th, 45th, 47th and 83rd in the top 88 general skills demand according to Labour Insight jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) (2018). Most of the top general skills are necessary basic skills, which are very important, and those that are ranked lower are mostly occupation-specific skills, which are very important for employees in that occupation as their advantage.<br />

            The three highest ranked IT-specific skills are not required are JavaScript, Microsoft C# and LINUX. The three highest ranked general skills are not required are Creativity, Leadership and quality assurance and control.<br />

            After browsing the data from Burning Glass, my view of my ideal job has not changed for the moment. It depends more on my expectations for the job than on my evaluation of the skill needs. It takes about six months for a company to train a technical support engineer. As a field engineer, I can not only work in the office, but also need to go to a specific location to meet with customers, which is in line with my expectation that I don't want to work in the office all the time. When providing technical support in the company, you can get to know more colleagues in different positions and may be involved in many management aspects of the company. After all, most of the work nowadays is inseparable from computers and networks. The most important thing is that this job should have considerable free time at your disposal.<br />
